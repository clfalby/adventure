<h2 id="Fiji">I fought Pirates off the coast of Fiji</h2>
<p>Once while on a cruise to <b>Easter Island</b>. My Norwegean cruiser was attacked by Swedish pirates with long orange beards. Initially we were relieved because the cruise line staff were unfriendly and the only entertainment they offered was Shuffleboard.  However, the Swedish liked to eat large quantities of Herring, which they made the passengers fish for morning and night. They also went on and on and on and on about how much they hated the Danes. I was fed up.</p>

<h2 id="pine gum">I cured a rare form of Cancer with an elastic, dental floss and pine gum</h2>
<p>While camping in the Atlas mountains, I encountered a rare orange possum that was obviously suffering some kind of trauma.  After performing a physical examination on the wild creature, I determined that it was suffering from a tumor on it's inner ear.</p>
